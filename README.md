## Activating

Rest can be activated by right-clicking your Run energy orb...

...or by right-clicking a player-made fire when adjacent to the fire and directly facing it.

These apply the Rest animation privately.

You can also publicly activate Rest by using the Spin emote. This overrides the regular Spin emote but will allow other players to see you Rest if they have the plugin active. Note that Spin still works for the purpose of completing clues!
